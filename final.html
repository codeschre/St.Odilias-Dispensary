                    Detailed history-taking is the second phase of consultation during which the doctor attempts to understand the reason for the patient’s attendance by simply asking the patient's history of the presenting complaint, set in the context of the patient's life and known medical conditions.
                    In the third phase, the doctor is involved in examining the patient’s health problem through physical examination which adds some further useful information.
                    Diagnosis is the fourth phase in which the doctor presents the patient’s health condition based on elicited medical information and it’s during this phase that patients are sent for additional laboratory tests or radiological examinations may be required to confirm the diagnosis.
                    The fifth stage is offering clinical treatment and professional advice by the doctor based on the patient’s diagnostic findings and discharges the patient through pharmacy.

            <p>One of the most important things that a parent can do for their child is to make sure that they have all their routine childhood vaccination at the right age and interval to protect them as early as possible and minimize the risks of infection.
                <span id="dots6">...</span><span id="more6">Vaccination is a simple, safe, and effective way of protecting your child against harmful diseases, before they come into contact with them. It uses the body’s natural defenses to build resistance to specific infections and makes your immune system stronger.
                    Vaccines train the immune system to create antibodies, just as it does when it’s exposed to a disease. However, because vaccines contain only killed or weakened forms of germs like viruses or bacteria, they do not cause the disease or put the child at risk of its complications.
                    Our clinics are on every Friday of the week .

            <h3>Minor Surgical Operation</h3>
            <p>Minor surgical procedures are a set of procedures in which short surgical techniques are applied on the superficial tissues, usually with local anaesthesia, and minimal complication.
                They usually do not require post-operative resuscitation and need minimal equipment, many of which are used on a daily basis and can be easily and safely performed in a short amount of time during hospital visit
            <span id="dots8">...</span><span id="more8">One of the special minor surgical operations we do is group circumcision of young boys at special prices who are for initiation to adulthood aimed at “trains in children” in areas like “leadership; expectations of adulthood and the role of the individual in the society; family values and parent-child relationship; and sexuality.
                Male circumcision, is the surgical removal of all or part of the foreskin of the penis is one of the oldest and most common surgical procedures worldwide. It is usually practiced for religious, and social –cultural reasons. Research evidence has in the past shown that male circumcision has a number of health benefits: including reduced risk in acquisition of urinary tract infections; syphilis; cancroid and the human papilloma virus in circumcised men and cervical cancer in women whose partners are circumcised. 
                Christianity has embraced the argument that circumcision was a community affair that enabled the initiate to holistically grow from childhood to adulthood in social, religious and physical aspects of their lives 
                St.Odilias dispensary in conjunction with Subiaco center also our facility within the same compound offer accommodation for such services

                Diabetes includes several different metabolic disorders that all, if left untreated, result in abnormally high concentration of sugar called glucose in the body. Hypertension is also known as High blood pressure. High pressure is the force exerted by the blood against the walls of the blood vessels. How great the pressure is depends on the work being done by the heart and the resistance of the blood vessels.
